> In October, the Samotsvety group updated their predictions. In a [blog post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2nDTrDPZJBEerZGrk/samotsvety-nuclear-risk-update-october-2022) published on October 3, they estimated that the chance of London being hit with a nuclear weapon in the next three months was now around 0.02 percent. Since their previous prediction only covered a single month, it’s hard to directly compare these forecasts in terms of micromorts, but [Sempere estimates](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground/#code=eNqVU8lu20AM%2FRXCpzaotwIGCiM9dAkKo01SwHZz0WUsURKREanOYsMI8u%2BlFieu06TIRRpuj%2B9xOHcDX8puGavKuP1gHlzEd63rIqMg7uAhpkDGLn9HKgqLy%2BCIi8F8MB7DJaVOKnEB0AeqTEAPOwolTKES1v8Gww6RNZwaawIJgw9Y%2B4QT1vqrmFo0DuKtM8SYsIuezNqj7yM3aGphv%2BB1lwEfYTKaTGYQpDnMOhQJCKE0QT8INTqSDCQHZYRAHizmASL7GlPKCbOT5lefVtcJPzK8jsFThn3Hb7TFQ%2Fcbo7xuMetYTDsS0xmAop0PISdrh8THWCtp0NecCutM1WGsFv9X5VnCAK9h9A9JDTvu7R%2FaXnis2aXeXRDN3lCx%2Fr5efqGwbxFa1ItnWnaC%2B6m%2Ff6L3COtU6sujOING6Kuo9EoXVW3SAMRgxQcoJTpdKrOxuJKmtMbPmIvrmPfEP5zyrg7r6zXtWRHtZbyZwhCewr8F1TC9bCn9dLLRjD0UovunHY318vAwgDISv%2BfUqagUcmUvzoOPaQnGQ4swhIXG0XhdMXGQ4cGonWQxDbRVco1mA6meXq6hhwn9lf3L2Ija0VPB2NL00W0VmYsudyfOZmDygE6twwbtiNXRY4xGo%2BYaWusr%2BdoaRb9rxgTwONP50bmLJXw%2FuP8DtRGUZA%3D%3D) that their projected risk for a Londoner over the next one-to-three months may now be around 40 micromorts

> Enter Samotsvety Forecasts. This is a team of some of the best superforecasters in the world. They won the CSET-Foretell forecasting competition by [an absolutely obscene margin](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EGHtomuh55375u7RT/forecasting-newsletter-march-2021), “around twice as good as the next-best team in terms of the relative Brier score”. If the point of forecasting tournaments is to figure out who you can trust, the science has spoken, and the answer is “these guys”.

> Why pay tens of thousands for a prediction market (which takes time and effort to organize) when you can just give a couple of grand to Nuño and get better answers, faster?

> With the right kind of marketing angle I could easily see Samotsvety becoming a kind of 21st century McKinsey for the hip SV crowd that wants to signal that it needs actual advice rather than political cover.

> The Good Judgment Project’s research also showed the value of working in teams. Teams who debated their forecasts (usually virtually) performed better than individuals working alone. Perhaps that’s yet another technique benefitting top forecaster Sempere (@Loki), who meets regularly with his two teammates, @yagudin (also in the top 1%) and @elifland, to discuss and evaluate questions from different angles.
